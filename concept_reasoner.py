You are a reasoning model specialising in organic chemistry problem design.

Task: select the best operators from the Concept Book to augment the seed problem
toward the target difficulty profile, given the full history of previous attempts.

Seed Problem: {blackboard.seed['question']}
Archetype: {blackboard.archetype}

Target Difficulty Profile:
{json.dumps(blackboard.target_profile, indent=2)}

Available Operators (Concept Book):
{json.dumps(concept_book, indent=2)}

Operators already used across previous attempts: {operators_tried}

Full Attempt History:
{context}

Reasoning instructions:
1. Work through which operators are valid for this archetype specifically.
2. If an operator caused a verifier rejection, reason about whether to retry it differently
   or avoid it entirely this pass.
3. If weak solver scored too high (problem not hard enough), push harder on interpretive operators.
4. If strong solver scored too low (problem may be unsolvable), prioritise chemical grounding
   over difficulty escalation.
5. Select 1-3 operators. Specify exactly how each should be applied.

Return a JSON object with:
- "selected_operators": list of operator names from the concept book
- "specific_constraints": dict mapping each operator name to exact parameters
- "reasoning": string explaining the selection logic
